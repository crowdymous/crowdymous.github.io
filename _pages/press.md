## Dead Drop is the world's first and only **perfectly meta-data-secure** communication app.

Dead Drop is the first and only communication app to use **Private Information Retrieval**
technology to secure all meta-data of a message exchange.

It is the first and only app in which even the existence of a message is unknowable. It is
cryptographically impossible to say whether any two people exchanged even a single message or not.
This guarantee does not come from deleting logs and/or physically securing servers, but from
hard cryptography.
