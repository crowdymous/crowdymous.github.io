## TL;DR

We (obviously) don't collect or store any information about you, except
the minimal subscription information we need and which
<i>outbox</i> is yours, if you are a subscriber.

#### It is cryptographically guaranteed that no information that we or any third parties collect or possess, even briefly, can be used to tell that you are even using the service for something.

## What data do we collect?

If you become a subscriber, we technically have to collect the following
data: what you ordered (the order id), and the proof (purchase token) that we can use
to check your subscription at Google. We also store how long that subscription lasts (expiration data).

We also store which <i>outbox</i> you are using on our servers. The outbox however
contains only encrypted information for which only your recipient(s) have
access to. No other parties, including us can tell what's in the <i>outbox</i>,
or even if there is something in it or not.

## How do we use data that is collected?

We use the subscription data to make sure you have access to our services. To do
this we call the appropriate Google services.

The <i>outbox</i> id is used to know which file to write on our servers.

## How and where do we store data?

The above data is always stored in an encrypted form at DigitalOcean's
Frankfurt / Germany facility.

## What information do we (or third parties) actually have?

If you are a subscriber of our service the only information any third party
(including us!) is able to know <i>is</i> that you are a subscriber.

This is the only information <i>at risk</i> on our servers. It is cryptographically
guaranteed that we <i>can't</i> know anything more, including whether you
have even sent or received a single message.

## How long is this data stored?

This data is stored from the point where you become a subscriber to when
the subscription ends. When the subscription ends the data is deleted
permanently.

Note, that as subscription information is managed by Google, where this same data
is under Google's Privacy Policy.

## Additional third parties

We do not use any trackers, advertisements, or any third party libraries that collect data.

## How to delete your data

You can permanently delete any information we store by deleting your subscription, for
example in the Google Play Store application, under "My Subscriptions".
