### The first app to cryptographically protect your social network in addition to protecting the contents of your messages.

Crowdymous releases Dead Drop for Android devices on the Google Play Store. It is the first 
communication app to use [Private Information Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_information_retrieval), a technology enabling perfect
meta-data protection.

The Dead Drop app and the underlying proprietary protocol is designed to leak no
statistical information whatsoever about message exchanges. Even if all data
that goes over the internet were to be collected and even if a hypothetical attacker would
have access to the Dead Drop servers somehow, the attacker would not be able to
tell whether even a single message was exchanged on Dead Drop.

We are very proud to have reached this milestone and looking forward to working
with users to continuously improve our app from here on.
