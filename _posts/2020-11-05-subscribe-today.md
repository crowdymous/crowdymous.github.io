> When you *need* Dead Drop, it may be too late!

While every piece of information about your usage of Dead Drop is completely
private and secure, the fact that you *are a user of* Dead Drop is visible. Similarly
when you *became* a user should be also considered non-secure information.

It is therefore easy to imagine that if you become a user during some
real-world events that you want to privately discuss with somebody else,
the mere timing of you becoming a user already **puts you potentially
under suspicion**.

The only way to preserve ***absolute privacy***[^1] is to become a user
before you actually need to be!
